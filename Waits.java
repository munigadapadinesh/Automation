		 * IMPLICIT WAIT: The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver
		 * to wait for a certain amount of time before it throws a “No Such Element
		 * Exception”. The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver
		 * will wait for the element for that time before throwing an exception.
	
	
		 * If we have declared an implicit wait with the time frame of 10 seconds. It
		 * means that if the element is not located on the web page within that time
		 * frame, it will throw an exception.
		 * 
		 // Syntax:
		 * 
		 * driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(TimeOut, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

		 * EXPLICIT WAIT: The Explicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the Web Driver
		 * to wait for certain conditions (Expected Conditions) or maximum time exceeded
		 * before throwing “ElementNotVisibleException” exception. It is an intelligent
		 * kind of wait, but it can be applied only for specified elements. It gives
		 * better options than implicit wait as it waits for dynamically loaded Ajax
		 * elements.
		 * 
		 * Syntax:
		 * 
		 * WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(WebDriverRefrence,TimeOut);
		 * wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("")));
		 * 
		 * conditions: elementToBeClickable() titleIs() elementToBeSelected()

		 * 
		 * Thread.sleep() method:
		 * 
		 * It is used to pause a thread for the specified amount of time
		 * 
		 * Syntax:

		 * Thread.sleep(500);
